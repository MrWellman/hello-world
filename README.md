# hello-world
I am just testing GitHub

My name is Luis, currently I don't have a lot of experience in programming but I'm looking forward to improve this year.

The reason that made me learn to program was Kerbal Operative System (a mod for a rockets game that lets you configure the flight of your ship). :D
